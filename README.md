# Infraohjelmointi API

Backend repository for infraohjelmointi API service in City of Helsinki.

Instructions in this README.md assume that you know  what __docker__ and __docker-compose__ are, and you already have both installed locally. Also you understand what __docker-compose up -d__ means.
This helps to keep the README.md concise.

## Setting up local development environment with Docker

In order to create placeholder for your own environment variables file, make a local `.env.template` copy:

```bash
$ cp .env.template .env
```

Then you can run docker image with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Access development server on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

- Login to admin interface with `admin` and ðŸ¥¥ at [localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)

- Done!

## Managing project packages

- We use `pip` to manage python packages we need
- After adding a new package to requirements.txt file, compile it and re-build the Docker image so that the container would have access to the new package

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

## Running tests
Still to come
